        Playful Layers explores how spatial boundaries can overlap, shift, and interact — producing playful conditions where public and private realms meet. The project investigates how adaptable partitions, textures, and transparencies can encourage new patterns of occupation and social interaction.

      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Conceived during Semester 2, 2023 at Columbia GSAPP, Playful Layers focuses on architectural layering as a performative device that mediates between privacy and collectivity. The design introduces adjustable partitions, reflective materials, and permeable boundaries that redefine everyday engagement within the domestic environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project emphasizes a continuous dialogue between visibility and concealment, allowing spaces to transform dynamically according to user interaction and time of day.
