        Mirrors in the Desert explores the reflective relationship between architecture and the arid landscape. The project investigates how mirroring surfaces and shifting light conditions reveal spatial perception and ecological interaction within desert environments.

      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Developed during Semester 1, 2025 at Columbia GSAPP, this project studies optical phenomena and atmospheric reflections across the desert terrain. It reinterprets architecture as an instrument for perceiving invisible climatic and light-based changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The proposal integrates experimental material systems that merge light, dust, and structure to frame new spatial experiences of heat, reflection, and time.
