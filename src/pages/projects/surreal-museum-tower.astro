      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Surreal Museum Tower redefines the relationship between architecture and human imagination.
        By embedding dream-like exhibition spaces within a vertical structure, visitors can explore
        experiences that shift between the subconscious and the real world.
