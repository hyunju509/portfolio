        Terroir Hot Spring investigates how natural geothermal processes and architectural intervention can coexist. The project focuses on the relationship between material behavior, topography, and bathing rituals to create a dialogue between the body and the environment.

      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Developed during Semester 1, 2024 at Columbia GSAPP, Terroir Hot Spring examines how thermal gradients, mineral deposits, and geological textures can shape spatial experience. The design merges geothermal activity with architectural tectonics to form a series of immersive bathing chambers embedded in the landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project explores the intersection of environmental systems and sensory experience—rethinking the hot spring as both an ecological and cultural construct.
