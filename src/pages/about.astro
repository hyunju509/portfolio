    <h1>Experiences why I am Obsessed with a Personalized Space</h1>
    <p>
      Most people avoid it, but there is a space I can never prevent. Since I was a kid, I have emphasized finding a
      “space that fits me.” The stability and comfort of the space that fits my height have always been unique. For
      example, the <span class="blue">seat above the bus wheel</span> was a place anyone tried to avoid, but I felt most comfortable there. Thanks
      to my petite height, the space fits my body perfectly, and if I could lean on the window, it could not be more
      perfect. The best time to ride the bus is in the morning when I go to school. The morning sun gently came through
      the window, and in winter, a subtle breeze entered when I opened the window slightly, wearing a cozy puffer. This
      space gave me more comfort and safety than any other space. Moreover, when the bus reached Namsan Mountain,
      covered with snow, I went past my stop just to enjoy the scenery from my favorite seat. It might be an unfavorable
      spot to others, but it was a <span class="blue">psychological shelter</span> beyond physical comfort for me.

      I tried to figure out why I liked this space and recalled some memories. As a small child, I would lie under my bed
      or desk, read a book, or play an architectural game called Minecraft. Then, I found comfort in small spaces, like
      when I put my feet up to the legs of the furniture. Since then, I have realized how important <span class="blue">a space that fits to reach my foot</span> is. Even when brushing my teeth, I felt stable only when I put my foot on the toilet and squatted
      one leg. This experience shifted my perspective on space and eventually led to the “Ordinary Village” project. This
      project explored a new approach to space by bringing a puppy into my home. My family always kept the door open
      because of the puppy, and that is when I thought about what the door could mean: a big moving wall for the puppy.
      It occurred to me that furniture legs <span class="blue">for people could be a pillar for a puppy</span>, which is how the “Puppy Plan” idea
      was born. This concept aimed to distinguish between human and animal space and to explore how space could meet the
      needs of different scales. Just as the “space that my foot can reach” I experienced as a child was my safe and
      comfortable space, I realized that even my dog was exploring her favorite space.

      Moreover, it made me think about how to reflect the psychology and preferences of humans and animals through
      architecture, which has become an essential element of spatial design. <span class="blue">Different people, even the same person, may have other preferred spaces depending on the situation and their experience</span>. Like the stability of the space I felt
      in my childhood and on the seat above the wheel of the bus, I realized that designing the right space for each
      individual is an important task that provides sensory stability beyond just physical design.
