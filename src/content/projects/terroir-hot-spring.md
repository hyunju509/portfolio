The project explores the **nature and imagination of dreams** and proposes a new museum typology redefining the relationship between reality and surrealism.  
It allows visitors to move away from conventional horizontal exhibitions to a **vertical Surreal Exhibition Tower** that inserts a “Surreal Exhibition Cube” into the everyday urban context.

Through its **interactive facade**, the tower transforms into a medium of perception, blurring boundaries between real and surreal.  
The experience enables visitors to explore **memorable, dream-like experiences** beyond their daily lives — offering psychological escape and stimulating creativity.
